= Pekko Streams


include::partial$include.adoc[]


{pekko}/stream/stream-introduction.html[Pekko Streams {tab-icon}, window="tab"] provides an intuitive and safe way to formulate stream processing setups such that we can then execute them efficiently and with bounded resource usage â€”- no more OutOfMemoryErrors.

The Pekko Streams API is completely decoupled from the xref:reactive-streams.adoc[] interfaces. While Pekko Streams focus on the formulation of transformations on data streams the scope of Reactive Streams is to define a common mechanism of how to move data across an asynchronous boundary without losses, buffering or resource exhaustion.

The relationship between Pekko Streams and Reactive Streams is that the Pekko Streams API is geared towards end-users while the Pekko Streams implementation uses the Reactive Streams interfaces internally to pass data between the different operators. What this means is that you can implement an application where Pekko Streams interconnect with other Reactive Streams implementations in a fully compatible way.
